1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?

  a. Theatre and music, i.e. entertainment fundraisers are more successful overall, possibly because of immediate return on investment and ability to enjoy the product and interact. Journalism is the least popular.
  
  b. There are differences between East and West and other countries. European countries and NA prefer entertainment, Asian and other prefer technology.
  
  c. Most successful campaigns start in the summer, least successful start around the Christmas holidays. 2010 to 2012 saw successful campaigns with few failures, 2014 to 2016 saw the rise of many campaigns with many failures, a much more competitive market. 	
  
2. What are some limitations of this dataset?

  a. Not enough variety in countries, limited data from Eastern countries, mostly Western countries.
  
  b. Data does not provide factors behind outcome.
  
  c. Data does not reflect profitability of project.
  
  d. Data does not reflect who paid for projects.
  
3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

  a. We could create tables that reflect category over time; i.e. years. 
  
  b. We could also analyze the time that passed between the launch and deadline date to see how this influences the outcome of the project.
